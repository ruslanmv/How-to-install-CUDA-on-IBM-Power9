Installing Python 3.10 on a PowerPC 64-bit little-endian architecture Red Hat system can be a bit involved, but I'll guide you through the process step by step.

**Prerequisites:**

1. You have a Red Hat system with a PowerPC 64-bit little-endian architecture (ppc64le).
2. You have a working internet connection.
3. You have sufficient disk space and memory available for the installation.

**Step 1: Install the necessary build dependencies**
a terminal and install the required build dependencies:
```
sudo dnf install -y epel-release
sudo dnf install -y gcc-c++ make automake autoconf libtool \
                   zlib-devel bzip2-devel expat-devel readline-devel \
                   sqlite-devel openssl-devel xz-devel
```
These packages are required to build Python 3.10 from source.

**Step 2: Download the Python 3.10 source code**

Download the Python 3.10 source code from the official Python website:
```
wget https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.10.5/Python-3.10.5.tar.xz
```
**Step 3: Extract the source code**

Extract the source code:
```
tar -xvf Python-3.10.5.tar.xz
```
**Step 4: Configure and build Python 3.10**

Change into the extracted source code directory:
```
cd Python-3.10.5
```
Configure Python 3.10 to build with the correct architecture:
```
./configure --enable-optimizations --prefix=/usr/local --build=ppc64le-redhat-linux-gnu
```
Build Python 3.10:
```
make -j4
```
The `-j4` flag tells `make` to use 4 parallel jobs, which can speed up the build process. Adjust this value according to your system's capabilities.

**Step 5: Install Python 3.10**
sudo dnf install gcc python3-devel
sudo wget https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.10.4/Python-3.10.4.tgz
sudo tar -xvf Python-3.10.4.tgz
cd Python-3.10.4
sudo ./configure --enable-optimizations
sudo make
sudo make install


Install Python 3.10:
```
sudo ./configure --enable-optimizations
sudo make
sudo make install
```
This will install Python 3.10 to `/usr/local/bin/python3.10`.

**Step 6: Verify the installation**

Verify that Python 3.10 is installed correctly:
```
/usr/local/bin/python3.10 --version
```
This should print `Python 3.10.5`.

**Additional Tips:**

* Make sure you have enough disk space and memory available for the installation.
* The build process may take some time, depending on your system's performance.
* If you encounter any issues during the build process, you can try running `make clean` and then `make` again.
* You can also install additional packages, such as `pip`, using the `make` command: `sudo make install-pip`

By following these steps, you should now have Python 3.10 installed on your Red Hat system with a PowerPC 64-bit little-endian architecture.


Here's a step-by-step guide to creating a new Python environment with PyTorch and CUDA compatibility on a PowerPC 64-bit little-endian architecture Red Hat system from source:

**Prerequisites:**

1. You have a Red Hat system with a PowerPC 64-bit little-endian architecture (ppc64le).
2. You have a working internet connection.
3. You have sufficient disk space and memore for the installation.
4. You have CUDA installed and configured on your system.

*p 1: Install the necessary dependencies**

Open a terminal and install the required dependencies:
```
sudo dnf install -y epel-release
sudo dnf install -y gcc-c++ make automake autoconf libtool \
                   zlib-devel bzip2-devel expat-devel readline-devel \
                   sqlite-devel openssl-devel xz-devel \
                   cuda-devel cuda-driver-devel
```
These packages are required to build PyTorch from source.

**Step 2: Clone the PyTorch repository**

Clone the PyTorch repository from GitHub:
```
git clone https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch.git

git clone -b v1.8.1 https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch.git --depth=1 pytorch_v1.8.1


```
**Step 3: Checkout the desired branch**

Checkout the desired branch (e.g., `v1.12.0`):
```
cd pytorch
git checkout v1.12.0
```

cd pytorch_v1.8.1
git submodule sync
git submodule update --init --recursive

**Step 4: Create a new Python environment**
Configure environment variables.
export USE_XNNPACK=0


Create a new Python environment using `python -m venv`:
```
python -m venv pytorch-env
```


Activate the environment:
```
source pytorch-env/bin/activate
```

pip install ipykernel

python -m ipykernel install --user --name Pytorch --display-name "Python (Pytorch)"

**Step 5: Install the required Python packages**
```
sudo dnf install libffi-devel
```

Install the required Python packages:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
**Step 6: BuilyTorch from source**

sudo dnf install cmake3


sudo dnf update cmake

Build PyTorch from source with CUDA support:
```
python3.10 setup.py install
python setup.py install --cuda
```
This will build PyTorch with CUDA support. The `-` flag tells PyTorch to build with CUDA support.


Compile and generate the binary installation package of the PyTorch plugin.
```
# Download the branch code of the corresponding PyTorch version and go to the root directory of the plugin. Take v1.8.1-3.0.0 as an example. For the 1.11.0 version, replace v1.8.1-3.0.0 with v1.11.0-3.0.0..
git clone -b v1.8.1-3.0.0 https://gitee.com/ascend/pytorch.git 
cd pytorch    

# Specify the Python version packaging mode. Python 3.7 is used as an example. For other Python versions, use --python=3.8 or --python3.9.
bash ci/build.sh --python=3.7
```



**Step 7: Verify PyTorch installation**

Verify that PyTorch is installed correctly:
```
python -c "import torch; print(torch.__version__)"
```
This should print the version of PyTorch installed.

**Step 8: Install additional packages (optional)**

You can install additional packages, such as `torchvision`, using pip:
```
pip install torchvision
```
**Step 9: Verify CUDA support**

Verify that PyTorch is using CUDA:
```
python -c "import torch; print(torch.cuda.is_available())"
```
This should print `True` if CUDA is available.

**Step 10: Deactivate the environment**

Deactivate the environment:
```
deactivate
```
You can now use your new Python environment with PyTorch and CUDA support on your PowerPC 64-bit little-endian architecture Red Hat system.

**Additional Tips:**

* Make sure you have enough disk space and memory available for the installation.
* The build process may take some time, depending on your system's performance.
* If you encounter any issues during the build process, you can try running `make clean` and then `make` again.
* You can also install additional packages, such as `pip`, using the `make` command: `sudo make install-pip`

By following these steps, you should now have a new Python environment with PyTorch and CUDA support on your PowerPC 64-bit little-endian architecture Red Hat system.












in the client side I would like to connect via tunneling ssh



1. Open a terminal on your local machine and run:

ssh -L 8888:localhost:8888 cecuser@129.40.98.225

source pytorch-env/bin/activate


I have a server that is running jupyter lab here witht thid command

jupyter lab --ip 0.0.0.0 --port 8888


This will establish the SSH connection and set up the tunnel.
2. Enter your password to authenticate with the remote server.
3. Once connected, open a web browser on your local machine (e.g., Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox).
4. Navigate to `http://localhost:8888` in the browser.
5. You should see the Jupyter Lab login page. Enter your Jupyter Lab credentials (if you have set up authentication) or proceed without authentication if you haven't set it up.
6. You should now be connected to Jupyter Lab running on the remote server, and you can access your notebooks and work as usual.

Remember to keep the SSH connection open in the terminal while you're working with Jupyter Lab. If you close the SSH connection, the tunnel will be terminated, and you'll lose access to Jupyter Lab.

If you encounter any issues or errors, feel free to ask, and I'll be happy to help you troubleshoot!
