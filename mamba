Here's a step-by-step guide to install PyTorch on Power 8 architecture with Red Hat 8 using Miniforge and Mamba:

**Step 1: Install Miniforge**

Download the Miniforge installer from the official website and install it:
```bash
wget https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge/releases/latest/download/Mambaforge-Linux-ppc64le.sh
bash Mambaforge-Linux-ppc64le.sh
```
Follow the installation instructions to complete the installation.

**Step 2: Create a new Mamba environment**

Create a new Mamba environment with the required dependencies:
```bash
mamba create -n pytorch-env python=3.10 cudatoolkit=11.2 cudnn libopenblas blas cmake ninja
```
This will create a new environment named `pv` with Python 3.10, CUDA Toolkit 11.2, cuDNN, OpenBLAS, BLAS, CMake, and Ninja.

**Step 3: Activate the environment**

Activate the newly created environment:
```bash
mamba activate pytorch-env
```
**Step 4: Clone PyTorch**

Clone the PyTorch repository and checkout the desired version (in this case, v1.12.1):
```bash
git clone https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch.git
cd pytorch
git checkout v1.12.1
```
**Step 5: Ignore MKL installation**

As you mentioned, ignore the PyTorch documentation's recommendation to install MKL.

**Step 6: Initialize submodules**

Initialize and update the submodules:
```bash
git submodule sync
git submodule update --init --recursive
```
**Step 7: Set MAX_JOBS**

Set the `MAX_JOBS` environment variable to limit the number of threads:
```bash
export MAX_JOBS=40
```
This sets the number of threads to 40, which is suitable for Power 8 architecturp 8: Build PyTorch**

Build PyTorch using the `setup.py` script:
```bash
python setup.py build
```
**Step 9: Create a wheel package**

Creata wheel packagyTorch:
```bash
python3 setup.py bdist_wheel
```
**Step 10: Install PyTorch**

Install PyTorch from the wheel package:
```bash
pip install dist/torch*.whl
```
**Step 11: Verify PyTorch installation**

Verify that PyTorch is installed correctly:
```bash
python3 -c 'import torch'
```
This should print the PyTorch version and confirm that the installation was successful.

**Additional notes:**

* Make sure you have the correct version of Python and the required dependencies installed.
* If you encounter issues during installation, you can try installing PyTorch from source using the instructions on the PyTorch website.
* For more information on installing PyTorch on Power 8 architecture, you can refer to the PyTorch documentation and the IBM PowerAI documentation.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions or issues.
