Here is the full solution:

**Install Anaconda on the server**

1. Download the Anaconda installer script using `wget`:
```bash
wget https://repo.continuum.io/archive/Anaconda3-2018.12-Linux-ppc64le.sh
```
2. Make the script executable:
```bash
chmod +x Anaconda3-2018.12-Linux-ppc64le.sh
```
3. Run the installer script:
```bash
./Anaconda3-2018.12-Linux-ppc64le.sh
```
Follow the installation prompts to install Anaconda. You can choose to install it for the current user or for all users.

**Configure Anaconda**

1. Once the installation is complete, add the Anaconda bin directory to your system's PATH environment variable:
```bash
echo ". /home/cecuser/anaconda3/etc/profile.d/conda.sh" >> ~/.bashrc
```
2. Reload your `~/.bashrc` file by running:
```bash
source ~/.bashrc
```
**Verify Anaconda installation**

1. Open a new terminal session or run `source ~/.bashrc` to apply the changes to your PATH.
2. Verify that Anaconda is installed by running:
```bash
conda --version
```
This should display the version of Anaconda installed on your system.

**Start Jupyter Lab on the server**

1. Activate the Anaconda environment:
```bash
conda activate
```
2. Start Jupyter Lab:`bashjupyter lab --ip 0.0.0.0 --port 8888
```
This will start Jupyter Lab on the server, listening on port 8888.

**Create an SSH tunnel from the client side**

1. On your local machine, create a new SSH tunnel to forward the Jupyter Lab port (8888) from the server to your local machine:
```bash
ssh -e.pem -L 8888:localhost:8888 cecuser@129.40.98.225
```
Replace `private.pem` with the path to your private key file, and `cecuser` with your username on the server.

**Access Jupyter Lab via the SSH tunnel**

1. On your local machine, open a web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8888`. This will connect you to the Jupyter Lab instance running on the server.

Note: Make sure to replace `private.pem` with the actual path to your private key file, and `cecuser` with your actual username on the server. Also, ensure that the key file has the correct permissions (e.g., `chmod 400 private.pem`) and is in a secure location.
