To load the NVIDIA driver from the provided RPM package on a Red Hat 8 server without rebooting, you can follow these steps:

**Prerequisites:**

1. Ensure you have the required dependencies installed:
```
sudo dnf install epel-release
sudo dnf install dkms
```
**Installing the NVIDIA driver:**

1. Download the RPM package:
```
wget https://us.download.nvidia.com/tesla/550.54.15/nvidia-driver-local-repo-rhel8-550.54.15-1.0-1.ppc64le.rpm
```
2. Install the RPM package:
```
sudo rpm -ivh nvidia-driver-local-repo-rhel8-550.54.15-1.0-1.ppc64le.rpm
```
**Loading the NVIDIA driver without rebooting:**

1. Stop the `nouveau` driver, which is the open-source NVIDIA driver that conflicts with the proprietary NVIDIA driver:
```
sudo systemctl stop nouveau
```
2. Unload the `nouveau` kernel module:
```
sudo rmmod nouveau
```
3. Update the `dkms` framework to recognize the new NVIDIA driver:
```
sudo dkms add -m nvidia -v 550.54.15
```
4. Build and install the NVIDIA kernel module:
```
sudo dkms build -m nvidia -v 550.54.15
sudo dkms install -m nvidia -v 550.54.15
```
5. Load the NVIDIA kernel module:
```
sudo modprobe nvidia
```
6. Verify that the NVIDIA driver is loaded by running:
```
lspci -k | grep -A 2 NVIDIA
```
This command should display information about the NVIDIA GPU and the loaded driver.

**Note:** If you encounter any issues or errors during this process, you may need to reboot your system to ensure the changes take effect.

Remember to exercise caution when working with kernel modules and drivers, as incorrect configurations can lead to system instability or crashes. If you're unsure about any of these steps, consider seeking guidance from a qualified system administrator or NVIDIA support resources.
